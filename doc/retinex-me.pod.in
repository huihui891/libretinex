This programs uses the Retinex algorithm to normalize the luminance of
an image.

Two arguments are required: an input file and an output file.

Optionnally, -a or --all can be passed to write in /tmp the images
associated with intermediary steps of the algorithm.

The flag -v or --verbosity controls how much information is displayed
while processing the image (0 means quiet).

Image reading and writing is delegated to the ViSP image processing
library. This library currently supports JPEG, PNG and PNM (P5, P7)
formats. See the ViSP documentation for more information.
